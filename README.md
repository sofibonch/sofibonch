# Hi there,

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate with a background in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of working as a research assistant at a psychology lab in my university, which allowed me to explore the intersection of technology and human cognition.

## Current Focus

At present, I am actively engaged in various projects that leverage my technical skills and passion for innovation. My primary goal is to secure a position in the software development world where I can apply my knowledge and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

## Areas of Interest

I have a keen interest in the graphical and game development aspects of the tech industry. I believe that the fusion of creativity and technology in these domains offers limitless opportunities for innovation and artistic expression.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on:

- **A roguelike 2D game in Godot:** Exploring the exciting world of game development and creating an immersive gaming experience.

- **A platform for Data organization:** Building a tool to simplify data management and organization, streamlining data-related tasks.

I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue learning and growing in the ever-evolving field of technology.

Feel free to reach out and connect with me!

## Hobbies

Outside the world of coding and technology, I have a few hobbies that keep me balanced. I'm an avid knitter, finding solace in the rhythmic motion of creating beautiful, handcrafted pieces. Reading is another passion of mine; I love getting lost in the worlds that books create. Lastly, I enjoy bouldering, a physically challenging activity that allows me to push my limits and stay fit.
